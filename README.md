# cmip7-development-mip-tables

MIP tables for use with CMOR v3.10+ in preparation for CMIP7

**THESE TABLES ARE FOR TESTING ONLY -- DO NOT USE THEM FOR PRODUCING DATA FOR PUBLICATION**

The exact nature of the global attributes required for CMIP7 is still under discussion. This repository is a temporary construct to allow 
interested parties to develop against anticipated CMIP7 standards **on the understanding that changes are extremely likely to happen**.

This repository will be removed when a suitable replacement has been produced.
