# cmip7-development-mip-tables

MIP tables for use with CMOR v3.10+ in preparation for CMIP7

**THESE TABLES ARE FOR TESTING ONLY -- DO NOT USE THEM FOR PRODUCING DATA FOR PUBLICATION**

The exact nature of the global attributes required for CMIP7 is still under discussion. This repository is a temporary construct to allow 
interested parties to develop against anticipated CMIP7 standards **on the understanding that changes are extremely likely to happen**.

This repository will be removed when a suitable replacement has been produced.

## Notes

The construction notebook shows how the tables and coordinates file was constructed from information in the [CMIP7 data request](https://github.com/CMIP-Data-Request/CMIP7_DReq_Software) and that 
in the [PCMDI/mip-cmor-tables](https://github.com/PCMDI/mip-cmor-tables) repository (used for CMIP6Plus).

The cmor demo notebook uses these tables and runs through a simple example using the tables based on one of the unit tests in [PCMDI/cmor](https://github.com/PCMDI/cmor).
